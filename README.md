## Hello 👋

I'm Clario, a junior front-end developer, always looking for the best way to create engaging digital experiences.🌱

Currently learning NextJs and TypeScript 🚀, and just completed an internship where I perfected my React skills by completely redesigning a [school website](https://lenvoldespapillons33.fr/) ! 💼

My personal and school projects have given me the opportunity to work with various technologies such as NodeJs, Tailwind, Ruby on Rails, SCSS, and PHP...

I'm on the lookout for a work-study placement for my second year at BUT MMI.🔍

Take a look at [my work](https://www.clariocadran.com/)! 👀
