## Hello 👋

I'm Clario, a front-end developer, always looking for the best way to create engaging digital experiences.🌱

Currently learning Three.js with Bruno Simon's course🚀, I completed an internship where I perfected my React skills by completely redesigning a [school website](https://lenvoldespapillons33.fr/) ! 💼

My personal and school projects have given me the opportunity to work with various technologies such as NodeJs, Tailwind, Ruby on Rails, SCSS, and PHP...

I'm on the lookout for an internship for my second year at BUT MMI.🔍

Take a look at [my work](https://www.clariocadran.com/) ! 👀
